# Problem Identification

```milestone 1```

## [Prologue](1_prologue.md)

I was considering some big ideas before this project, and before my friend suggested checking Concordia. The whole history could be read in the [Prologue](1_prologue.md) document. 

Current project will asks important questions about LLMs, based on this ideas. Without answering them it would be unwise to go any further. 

This project could be a part of something bigger, like what is described in the [Prologue](1_prologue.md) part. I am considering possible intersections with scenic art, psychology, science fiction, and many more. The relevance of such ideas could only be known by answering this project research questions.

This questions are important not only in this context, but to the general field of LLMs and ML. 

## [Research Questions](2_reseach_questions.md)

*Can we really rely on LLMs to simulate human beings?*

*How accurate could the results of such simulations be?*

*Are there any factors in setting, that influence accuracy and appropriateness of such simulations?*

*Can we consider hybrid approach to social simulation?*


## Project Description

The general approach of [Concordia](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia) to model living beings using LLMs and simulate virtual space inhabited by these "LLM-powered beings". One of the main proposed applications is social modeling, simulation, and predicting behavioral patterns of populations. In this project we will try to find out can really rely on LLMs to simulate humans, and to what extent. 

- We will find several real life simulations with known results that can be transformed into the Concordia virtual settings and modeled there. 
- We will run this simulation in Concordia. Check the settings and fine-tunings. 
- See our results and compare it to the known results of the simulation we choose.
- See what we have got, what we have to consider or change, what we have as answers.

### Concordia

### LLM engine

The original idea was to use [**OpenAI ChatGPT API**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation) as a main LLM, as it is suggested in the Concordia documentation. But considering possible constraints - time and money, that will be required by thousands of requests (as can be imagined) of simulation, we will additionally explore another option of using llama LLM and Ragdoll API framework (with possible modifications):

## [Constraints](3_constraints.md)

One of the constraints could be finding appropriate documented social simulation with known results. Other - time and money needed to run such simulation, if we will use ChatGPT API. Final - interpreting the results. [Read more...](3_constraints.md)

## [Project Scope and Learning Goals](4_learning_goals.md)

The research question are important by themselves, and by their influence on the further steps in this area. Learning goals - experience in different planes. [Read more...](4_learning_goals.md)
