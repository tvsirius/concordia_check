# Research Questions

*Can we really rely on LLMs to simulate human beings?*

*How accurate could the results of such simulations be?*

*Are there any factors in setting, that influence accuracy and appropriateness of such simulations?*

*Can we consider hybrid approach to social simulation?*


## Analytical Framework  

*Can we really rely on LLMs to simulate human beings?*
- simulate them in what settings? simulate which aspects of human beings? social/interaction dynamics? individual responses?
- how would you measure this? sentiment analysis?

*How accurate could the results of such simulations be?*
- like above, accurate on which measures? in which settings? and how might you measure this?

*Are there any factors in setting, that influence accuracy and appropriateness of such simulations?*
- this will be a stronger research question once you have defined the settings. then you can start into specific factors.

*Can we consider hybrid approach to social simulation?*
- again, what setting and what aspects? and to what aims in this setting?
