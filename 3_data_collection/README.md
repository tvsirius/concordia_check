# Data Collection

```milestone 3```

## Objectives

In this milestone objective is finding several real life simulations with known results. Wwe will be satisfied with 1 - 2, if we didn't find much. The desired number should be 4 - 7.

## Criteria

- well documented
- from real life
- known results, 
- results could be presented in compatible format, so we would be able to compare them  
- populations could be transformed to Concordia actors
- settings could be transformed to Concordia GM settings


## Criteria updates

Having run several demo scene, I have come to this additional criteria, based on conclusions:

- Small setup: find simulation with 1-10 involved persons. Fields could include psychology, experimental theater, role-playing games
- For larger scale: the features of population that matters in simulation should be simple, and be based on simple decision, on simple reasoning on simple facts. We could sure expect that small increase in complexity would result in much increase of computations required with large scale simulations
