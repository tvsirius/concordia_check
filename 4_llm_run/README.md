# LLM Simulation run

```milestone 4```

## Objectives

> Past objective: In this milestone we will explore and deploy local LLM, starting with Llama 3. Starting our first run of best simulation found. Optimizing approach to simulations. If possible we will compare one run using local LLM and OpenAI LLM. **This objective was postponed to the future development. Until now ChatGPT 3.5 or 4-omni (pros and cons considered) will satisfy our needs 

Algorithm for running simulations, from [data collection fits](../3_data_collection/README.md#fits): 

1. Settings the experiment into Concordia settings. Trying to minimize bias.
2. Run
3. Results observation
4. Interviewing participants
5. Was the settings ok? - If not goto p. 1, it yes - continue
6. Thought on the results

## 1. [Stanford Prison Experiment](<Stanford Prison Experiment>)

A big one. Original expectations did not prove, and there is much to consider. [See more...](<Stanford Prison Experiment>)
