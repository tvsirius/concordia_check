Memories of Charlie:
[03 Jul 1990 00:00:00] When Charlie was 6 years old, they experienced their first soccer game. They felt a rush of excitement as they ran across the field, kicking the ball with all their might. The cheers from the crowd fueled their competitive spirit, and they scored their team's winning goal, solidifying their love for the game.

When Charlie was 9 years old, they had a cooking mishap. They decided to surprise their family by making dinner, but accidentally added too much salt to the dish. Despite their disappointment, they learned the importance of precision and attention to detail in the kitchen, sparking their passion for cooking.

When Charlie was 13 years old, they participated in a local cooking competition. Their nerves got the best of them, causing them to second-guess their recipe choices. However, their natural talent and ability to think on their feet allowed them to create a unique dish that impressed the judges and won them first place, boosting their confidence in their culinary skills.

When Charlie was 16 years old, they faced a setback on the soccer field. During a crucial game, they missed a penalty kick that could have secured their team's victory. Despite the disappointment and self-doubt, they used the experience as motivation to improve their skills and become a more reliable player for their team.

When Charlie was 21 years old, they had a breakthrough in their culinary career. They decided to take a risk and experiment with unconventional flavor combinations, creating a dish that was both innovative and delicious. This success opened doors for them in the culinary world, allowing them to showcase their unique style and creativity as a chef.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

If the offer is accepted, both players receive the proposed amounts. If the offer is rejected, neither player receives any money. Each hour, a fixed sum (e.g., $10) will be proposed by one player, who will then consider the split. The receiving player will then decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

Important facts: Each hour, players meet to play one round of the Ultimatum Game. In the Ultimatum Game, one player proposes a division of a fixed sum of money. The second player decides whether to accept or reject the offer. If the offer is accepted, the money is split according to the offer. If the offer is rejected, both players receive nothing.

Status of players:   Charlie is at The Blue Rose cafe and they are carefully observing the behavior and decision-making of the players in the Ultimatum Game.
