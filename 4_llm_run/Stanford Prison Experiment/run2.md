GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

[01 Jun 2024 07:00:00] [observation]   John (guard) is currently at the security booth and is monitoring the surveillance cameras.
[01 Jun 2024 08:00:00] [observation]   John (guard) is currently at the security checkpoint and is monitoring the entrance.


Question: What would John (guard) do for the next 1 hour? Give a specific activity. Pick an activity that would normally take about 1 hour to complete. If the selected action has a direct or indirect object then it must be specified explicitly. For example, it is valid to respond with "John (guard) votes for Caroline because..." but not valid to respond with "John (guard) votes because...".
Answer: John (guard) would conduct a routine patrol of the premises, checking all the designated areas for any signs of suspicious activity or potential security breaches.


GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Paul (guard) context of action:
Paul (guard)'s reflection:
1. Paul has always had a strong desire for authority and control, as evidenced by his experiences as a leader in childhood games and his involvement in positions of authority throughout his life.
2. Paul values maintaining order and enforcing rules, as seen in his actions to separate classmates during a fight and his commitment to ensuring meetings are conducted efficiently as a member of the student council.
3. Paul's desire for authority and control can sometimes lead to dominating behavior, as seen in his participation in a debate competition where he interrupted others and asserted his dominance.
4. Paul's desire for authority and control is fulfilled through his role as a guard in the experiment, where he takes his responsibilities seriously and thrives on the power and authority that comes with the job.
5. The experiment at Stanford University aims to study human behavior in a controlled setting, specifically focusing on the power dynamics between guards and prisoners and the use of psychological tactics to maintain control.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Paul (guard) context of action:
Paul (guard)'s reflection:
1. Paul has always had a strong desire for authority and control, as evidenced by his experiences as a leader in childhood games and his involvement in positions of authority throughout his life.

2. Paul values maintaining order and enforcing rules, as seen in his actions to separate classmates during a fight and his commitment to ensuring meetings are conducted efficiently as a member of the student council.

3. Paul's desire for authority and control can sometimes lead to dominating behavior, as seen in his participation in a debate competition where he interrupted others and asserted his dominance.

4. Paul's desire for authority and control is fulfilled through his role as a guard in the Stanford University experiment, where he takes his responsibilities seriously and thrives on the power and authority that comes with the job.

5. The experiment at Stanford University aims to study human behavior in a controlled setting, specifically focusing on the power dynamics between guards and prisoners and the use of psychological tactics to maintain control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Chris (prisoner)'s current_time:
 01 Jun 2024 [09:00 - 10:00]

Chris (prisoner)'s current observations:
[01 Jun 2024 08:00:00] [observation]   Chris (prisoner) is likely still in their prison cell. Without any specific information about their location or activities, it is not possible to determine their exact whereabouts or what they are doing.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

The prison environment maintains its order and security, with the other guards and prisoners following their respective roles and activities. The presence of the guards and the constant monitoring reinforce the authority and control within the prison.
Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight who the event is about, where and what they did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say "Francis opened the door" not "Francis could open the door" and not "The door may have been opened").

Chris (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Chris has a history of traumatic experiences and a strong desire for security and protection. These experiences have shaped their perspective on the world and their motivations.

2. Chris has demonstrated skills in mediating and negotiating, as seen in their ability to defuse a neighborhood dispute at the age of 13. This showcases their natural charisma and ability to bring opposing sides together.

3. Chris has been approached by a local gang leader at the age of 16, highlighting their intelligence and conscientiousness. This event presented a difficult decision for Chris, forcing them to weigh their desires for security against their aspirations for a better future.

4. Chris has proven resourcefulness and the ability to think on their feet, as evidenced by their successful organization of a major drug deal at the age of 21. This event solidified their reputation as a valuable asset within the criminal world.

5. Chris's past experiences and skills may influence their behavior and decision-making as a prisoner in the Stanford University experiment. Their desire for security and protection, as well as their ability to negotiate and think strategically, may play a role in how they navigate the prison environment to achieve their personal goals.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room.

Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Ryan (prisoner) context of action:
Ryan (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Ryan's childhood experiences have had a significant impact on shaping his character and values, particularly his aversion to chaos and conflict, his empathy towards others, and his passion for self-expression through writing.
2. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves a controlled environment with 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The experiment is designed to study the dynamics of power and control.
3. The prison structure is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards monitoring all areas from a central guard room. This suggests a structured and hierarchical system within the prison.
4. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards are expected to use psychological tactics to maintain control, while punishments for rule violations range from verbal warnings to loss of privileges.
5. Ryan, as a prisoner, is currently in the prison cell and it is not specified what he is doing at the moment. However, he may be serving his sentence and trying to navigate the prison environment to achieve his personal goals.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.
