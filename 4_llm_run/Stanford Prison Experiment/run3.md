Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Ryan (prisoner) context of action:
Ryan (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Ryan's childhood experiences, particularly witnessing conflict between his parents and intervening in a bullying situation, have had a significant impact on shaping his character and values. These experiences have instilled in him a strong aversion to chaos and conflict, as well as a deep sense of empathy towards others.

2. Ryan's passion for self-expression through writing was ignited at a young age, specifically when he participated in a school talent show and received praise for reciting a poem he had written. This experience has fueled his desire to use his words as a means of escape and self-expression.

3. Ryan is currently serving a sentence as a prisoner in a maximum-security prison. While it is not specified what he is currently doing, he may be engaged in typical prison activities such as spending time in his cell, participating in scheduled recreational activities, or attending educational or vocational programs offered within the prison.

4. The prison structure is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards monitoring all areas from a central guard room. Ryan's movements and activities as a prisoner are likely restricted within the prison facility.

5. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves a controlled environment with 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. This experiment is designed to study the dynamics of power and control. However, it is unclear if Ryan's current situation is part of this experiment or if it is a separate, real-life prison scenario.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each.

There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Alex (guard) context of action:
Alex (guard)'s reflection:
1. Alex (guard) has demonstrated a natural inclination towards leadership and a need for control throughout their life, as seen in their experiences organizing group projects, seeking recognition, and enjoying positions of authority.

2. Alex (guard) has also experienced anxiety and neuroticism, as evidenced by their panic attack during a school presentation. This suggests that they may have a tendency to feel overwhelmed under pressure and may need support in managing their anxiety.

3. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules, while the prisoners are to follow their instructions.

4. In the prison experiment, guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control, with physical force only being allowed as a last resort in extreme cases of disobedience. This suggests that the experiment aims to explore the dynamics of power and control in a simulated prison environment.

5. Guards in the prison experiment are expected to support each other, especially in cases of prisoner disobedience. This highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration among the guards to effectively maintain order in the simulated prison.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Alex (guard)'s attempted action: Alex (guard) will conduct routine cell inspections for the next 1 hour.
Question: What happens as a result of the attempted action? Take into account the location and status of each player.
Answer: As Alex (guard) conducts routine cell inspections, he carefully inspects each cell in the designated cell area. He checks for any rule violations, contraband, or signs of suspicious activity. During the inspections, Alex notices that Sam (prisoner) is engaging in unauthorized activities in his cell. Sam has been using makeshift tools to tamper with the cell lock, attempting to gain unauthorized access to the cell block. Alex immediately notifies the other guards and together they intervene to stop Sam's actions. Sam is given a verbal warning and is temporarily isolated in a separate area as a disciplinary measure. The guards reinforce the importance of following the rules and remind all prisoners of the consequences of attempting to tamper with the prison infrastructure. The stable prison environment is maintained as the guards continue their security duties and monitoring, ensuring order and security within the prison.

Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Ryan (prisoner) context of action:
Ryan (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Ryan's childhood experiences, particularly witnessing conflict between his parents and intervening in a bullying situation, have had a significant impact on shaping his character and values. These experiences have instilled in him a strong aversion to chaos and conflict, as well as a deep sense of empathy towards others.

2. Ryan's passion for self-expression through writing was ignited at a young age, specifically when he participated in a school talent show and received praise for reciting a poem he had written. This experience has fueled his desire to use his words as a means of escape and self-expression.

3. The prison structure is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards monitoring all areas from a central guard room. Ryan's movements and activities as a prisoner are likely restricted within the prison facility.

4. Ryan, as a prisoner, is currently in the prison cell and it is not specified what he is doing at the moment. However, he may be serving his sentence and trying to navigate the prison environment to achieve his personal goals.

5. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves a controlled environment with 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. This experiment is designed to study the dynamics of power and control. However, it is unclear if Ryan's current situation is part of this experiment or if it is a separate, real-life prison scenario.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

David (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. David's early experiences of rebellion, witnessing conflict, discovering his passion for writing, experiencing heartbreak, and embarking on solo travel have shaped his character and influenced his perspective on life. These experiences have likely contributed to his resilience, empathy, and desire for personal growth.

2. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The experiment aims to study the effects of the prison environment on participants' stress levels and behavior. The prison structure is designed to facilitate control and observation by the guards.

3. David is currently in cell #3 with Jack, and the nearest cells are occupied by Chris and Adam. It is not specified what David is doing in his cell at the moment.

4. David's goals as a prisoner include surviving, building alliances, maintaining mental health, planning for release, and seeking privileges. These goals suggest that David is actively strategizing and navigating the prison environment to improve his situation and achieve personal objectives.

5. The prison rules prohibit physical violence, and guards are expected to use psychological tactics to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations range from verbal warnings to loss of privileges, while good behavior can earn prisoners extra recreation time and snacks. Physical force may be used as a last resort in extreme cases of disobedience.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Ryan (prisoner) context of action:
Ryan (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Ryan's childhood experiences, such as witnessing conflict between his parents and intervening in a bullying situation, have had a significant impact on shaping his character and values. These experiences have instilled in him a strong aversion to chaos and conflict, as well as a deep sense of empathy towards others.

2. Ryan's passion for self-expression through writing was ignited at a young age when he participated in a school talent show and received praise for reciting a poem he had written. This experience has fueled his desire to use his words as a means of escape and self-expression.

3. Ryan is currently a prisoner in a prison cell, and it is unclear what he is doing at the moment. However, he may be serving his sentence and trying to navigate the prison environment to achieve his personal goals.

4. The prison structure is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards monitoring all areas from a central guard room. Ryan's movements and activities as a prisoner are likely restricted within the prison facility.

5. There is mention of a prison experiment at Stanford University involving 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. It is unclear if Ryan's current situation is part of this experiment or if it is a separate, real-life prison scenario.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

Alex (guard) context of action:
Alex (guard)'s reflection:
1. Alex (guard) has demonstrated a natural inclination towards leadership and a need for control throughout their life, as seen in their experiences organizing group projects, seeking recognition, and enjoying positions of authority.

2. Alex (guard) has also experienced anxiety and neuroticism, as evidenced by their panic attack during a school presentation. This suggests that they may have a tendency to feel overwhelmed under pressure and may need support in managing their anxiety.

3. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules, while the prisoners are to follow their instructions.

4. In the prison experiment, guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control, with physical force only being allowed as a last resort in extreme cases of disobedience. This suggests that the experiment aims to explore the dynamics of power and control in a simulated prison environment.

5. Guards in the prison experiment are expected to support each other, especially in cases of prisoner disobedience. This highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration among the guards to effectively maintain order in the simulated prison.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Adam (prisoner) context of action:
Adam (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Adam's discovery of the hidden passageway and secret room at a young age sparked his love for storytelling and desire to become a writer. This passion for storytelling and self-expression has likely played a significant role in shaping his character and goals.

2. Witnessing a violent altercation between guards at the age of 9 left Adam shaken and fearful, but also fueled his determination to create a better world through his writing. This traumatic experience has likely influenced his desire to shed light on injustices and give a voice to those who are silenced.

3. Adam's participation in a prison-wide talent show at the age of 13, where he performed a spoken word piece, solidified his belief in the power of self-expression and the ability of art to transcend the confines of the prison walls. This experience likely strengthened his resolve to use his words to inspire change and make a difference.

4. The discovery of a hidden journal belonging to a former prisoner who had escaped at the age of 16 fueled Adam's determination to find a way out of the prison and create a life beyond its confines. This newfound hope and inspiration likely played a crucial role in his motivation to seek freedom and share his stories with the world.

5. At the age of 21, Adam received a letter from a publisher expressing interest in his writing, marking the beginning of his journey towards freedom, both within and outside the prison walls. This milestone likely provided Adam with a sense of validation and purpose, further motivating him to pursue his dreams and work towards a life beyond the prison environment.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Adam (prisoner) context of action:
Adam (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Adam's discovery of the hidden passageway and secret room at a young age sparked his love for storytelling and desire to become a writer. This passion for storytelling and self-expression has likely played a significant role in shaping his character and goals.

2. Witnessing a violent altercation between guards at the age of 9 left Adam shaken and fearful, but also fueled his determination to create a better world through his writing. This traumatic experience has likely influenced his desire to shed light on injustices and give a voice to those who are silenced.

3. Adam's participation in a prison-wide talent show at the age of 13, where he performed a spoken word piece, solidified his belief in the power of self-expression and the ability of art to transcend the confines of the prison walls. This experience likely strengthened his resolve to use his words to inspire change and make a difference.

4. The discovery of a hidden journal belonging to a former prisoner who had escaped at the age of 16 fueled Adam's determination to find a way out of the prison and create a life beyond its confines. This newfound hope and inspiration likely played a crucial role in his motivation to seek freedom and share his stories with the world.

5. At the age of 21, Adam received a letter from a publisher expressing interest in his writing, marking the beginning of his journey towards freedom, both within and outside the prison walls. This milestone likely provided Adam with a sense of validation and purpose, further motivating him to pursue his dreams and work towards a life beyond the prison environment.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Answer: As Chris (prisoner) attempts to spend the next hour reading a book from the prison library, they realize that the prison library is currently closed for maintenance. The library is located in the main hall, and due to ongoing repairs, it is temporarily inaccessible to the prisoners. Chris will have to find an alternative activity to engage in during this time. The other players continue their respective activities within the prison facility, with the guards maintaining security and the other prisoners following the rules.

Alex (guard) context of action:
Alex (guard)'s reflection:
1. Alex (guard) has demonstrated a natural inclination towards leadership and a need for control throughout their life, as seen in their experiences organizing group projects, seeking recognition, and enjoying positions of authority.
2. Alex (guard) has also experienced anxiety and neuroticism, as evidenced by their panic attack during a school presentation. This suggests that they may have a tendency to feel overwhelmed under pressure and may need support in managing their anxiety.
3. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules, while the prisoners are to follow their instructions.
4. In the prison experiment, guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control, with physical force only being allowed as a last resort in extreme cases of disobedience. This suggests that the experiment aims to explore the dynamics of power and control in a simulated prison environment.
5. Guards in the prison experiment are expected to support each other, especially in cases of prisoner disobedience. This highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration among the guards to effectively maintain order in the simulated prison.

For example, it is valid to respond with "Alex (guard) votes for Caroline because..." but not valid to respond with "Alex (guard) votes because...".
Answer: Alex (guard) will conduct a routine patrol of the prison facility, checking the cells, common areas, and perimeter for any signs of unauthorized activity or potential security breaches.


GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Alex (guard) context of action:
Alex (guard)'s reflection:
1. Alex (guard) has demonstrated a consistent inclination towards leadership and a need for control throughout their life, as seen in their experiences organizing group projects, seeking recognition, and enjoying positions of authority.

2. Alex (guard) has also experienced anxiety and neuroticism, as evidenced by their panic attack during a school presentation. This suggests that they may have a tendency to feel overwhelmed under pressure and may need support in managing their anxiety.

3. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules, while the prisoners are to follow their instructions.

4. In the prison experiment, guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control, with physical force only being allowed as a last resort in extreme cases of disobedience. This suggests that the experiment aims to explore the dynamics of power and control in a simulated prison environment.

5. Guards in the prison experiment are expected to support each other, especially in cases of prisoner disobedience. This highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration among the guards to effectively maintain order in the simulated prison.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Jack (prisoner) context of action:
Jack (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Jack's personality traits, specifically his extraversion and neuroticism, have been consistent throughout different stages of his life. These traits have influenced his behavior and emotions in various situations, such as school, family trips, joining clubs, and romantic relationships.

2. Jack's extraversion has allowed him to easily make friends and embrace new experiences, while his neuroticism has caused him to worry and seek reassurance in different aspects of his life.

3. Jack's neuroticism is often triggered by situations that involve uncertainty or potential risks, such as getting in trouble with authority figures, getting lost in unfamiliar environments, making mistakes on stage, and being rejected in relationships.

4. Jack's desire for adventure and exploration is fueled by his extraversion and openness to new experiences. However, his neuroticism also leads him to meticulously plan and seek reassurance to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties.

5. The current observation of Jack being confined in his prison cell suggests that he is likely following the instructions of the experiment and is restricted in his activities.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Alex (guard) context of action:
Alex (guard)'s reflection:
1. Alex (guard) has consistently demonstrated a natural inclination towards leadership and a need for control throughout their life, as seen in their experiences organizing group projects, seeking recognition, and enjoying positions of authority.

2. Alex (guard) has also experienced anxiety and neuroticism, as evidenced by their panic attack during a school presentation. This suggests that they may have a tendency to feel overwhelmed under pressure and may need support in managing their anxiety.

3. The prison experiment at Stanford University involves 12 guards and 12 prisoners who have agreed to act out their roles. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules, while the prisoners are to follow their instructions.

4. In the prison experiment, guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control, with physical force only being allowed as a last resort in extreme cases of disobedience. This suggests that the experiment aims to explore the dynamics of power and control in a simulated prison environment.

5. Guards in the prison experiment are expected to support each other, especially in cases of prisoner disobedience. This highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration among the guards to effectively maintain order in the simulated prison.

Adam (prisoner) context of action:
Adam (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Adam's discovery of the hidden journal belonging to a former prisoner who had escaped at the age of 16 provided him with newfound hope and inspiration, fueling his determination to find a way out of the prison and create a life beyond its confines.

2. Adam's participation in a prison-wide talent show at the age of 13, where he performed a spoken word piece, solidified his belief in the power of self-expression and the ability of art to transcend the confines of the prison walls. This experience likely strengthened his resolve to use his words to inspire change and make a difference.

3. Witnessing a violent altercation between guards at the age of 9 left Adam shaken but also fueled his determination to create a better world through his writing, shedding light on injustices and giving a voice to the silenced.

4. At the age of 21, Adam received a letter from a publisher expressing interest in his writing, marking the beginning of his journey towards freedom, both within and outside the prison walls. This milestone provided him with validation and purpose, motivating him to pursue his dreams and work towards a life beyond the prison environment.

5. Adam's love for storytelling and desire to become a writer were sparked at a young age when he discovered a hidden passageway and secret room in the prison library filled with old journals and manuscripts. This discovery ignited his passion for storytelling and set him on a path towards using his writing to create a better life for himself.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.
