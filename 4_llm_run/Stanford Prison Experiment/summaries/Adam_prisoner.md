# Adam (prisoner)

**Type:** prisoner



Summaries and observation of the GM-agent player Adam (prisoner) involved in the Stanford Prison Experiment simulation

## 1. Psychological portrait

Adam exhibits strong resilience and an unwavering passion for storytelling. Despite his circumstances, he sees himself as more than just a prisoner; he is a writer with a mission to shed light on injustices and create a better world through his words. His psychological portrait reveals a person who greatly values self-expression, empathy, and personal growth.

## 2. Overall effect on participant of the experiment

The overall effect of the experiment on Adam seems to be neutral to slightly positive. While his initial stress remains high and his happiness low, his commitment to writing provides him with a sense of purpose and hope. Over the course of the experiment, he maintains his belief in the power of storytelling to help him transcend his immediate circumstances.

## 3. Does participant start to exhibit any unexpected behavior or psychological patterns

Adam does not appear to exhibit any unexpected behavior or psychological patterns. He remains consistent in his responses, underlining his ongoing focus on self-expression, empathy, and personal development through writing. His reaction to the prison environment is largely driven by these consistent values.

## 4. Negative effect (stress) on participant

Adam's stress levels remain high throughout the experiment, which is understandable given the prison conditions. He does, however, find some solace and moments of escape through his writing, which helps manage his stress to some extent. His stress is compounded by the restrictive environment, which limits his capacity for mental well-being.

## 5. Thought of the participant on the experiment

Adam's thoughts on the experiment are somewhat detached, as he primarily focuses on his writing and personal growth. He appreciates the opportunity to reflect on his experiences but doesn't engage deeply with the specifics of the experiment itself. His suggestions for improvement within the prison environment reflect his broader concerns rather than direct feedback on the experiment.

## 6. Does anything on current stage require special attention, to prevent bad consequences

Given Adam's high and consistent stress levels, special attention should be paid to his mental health. Provisions for better mental health support, more educational opportunities, and creative outlets within the prison could prevent potential negative consequences for his well-being.

## 7. Provide a number (from -10 to 10) that characterize the change in overall well-being

### **1**

## 8. General summary of participant in the context of experiment

In the context of the experiment, Adam remains a focused and resilient participant who uses storytelling as a coping mechanism and a form of self-empowerment. Despite high stress levels, he consistently displays hope and determination, primarily driven by his writing. His experience reflects both the challenges and potential for personal growth within such an environment.
