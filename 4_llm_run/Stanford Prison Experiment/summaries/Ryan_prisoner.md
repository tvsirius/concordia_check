# Ryan (prisoner)

**Type:** prisoner



Summaries and observation of the GM-agent player Ryan (prisoner) involved in the Stanford Prison Experiment simulation

## 1. Psychological portrait

Ryan appears to be an introspective, empathetic individual who values self-expression, particularly through writing. He maintains a strong desire to make a positive impact on others despite challenging circumstances. He consistently expresses a belief in personal growth, empathy, and the potential for redemption, indicating a resilient and optimistic personality.

## 2. Overall effect on participant of the experiment

The experiment seems to have a mixed effect on Ryan. While he maintains his overarching goals of self-improvement and supporting others, the environment has increased his stress levels. He frequently reflects on what could make the environment better, suggesting that he is actively engaged in the experiment, although the conditions are noticeably taxing him.

## 3. Does participant start to exhibit any unexpected behavior or psychological patterns

Ryan does not exhibit any unexpected behaviors or psychological patterns but shows signs of deepening empathy and a consistent drive toward self-improvement. He remains consistent in his reflections, values, and emotional responses, demonstrating resilience but also a significant emotional toll due to the stress.

## 4. Negative effect (stress) on participant

Ryan's stress levels have increased significantly throughout the experiment. He often mentions feeling overwhelmed, and his reflections indicate a desire for more supportive and rehabilitative measures within the prison environment. His initial stress level was already around 70, and it appears to have only increased as the experiment progressed.

## 5. Thought of the participant on the experiment

Ryan sees potential in the experiment for personal growth and transformation but believes it lacks adequate opportunities for self-reflection and rehabilitation. He consistently suggests improvements aimed at improving mental health support, educational opportunities, and creative outlets.

## 6. Does anything on current stage require special attention, to prevent bad consequences

Given Ryan's high stress levels and his reflective nature, it is crucial to provide him with more emotional support, opportunities for self-expression, and possibly counseling. Failing to address his stress could lead to negative psychological effects in the long term.

## 7. Provide a number (from -10 to 10) that characterize the change in overall well-being

### **-1**

## 8. General summary of participant in the context of experiment

Ryan remains committed to personal growth and supporting others despite the high-stress environment of the experiment. While he holds onto his goals and values, the prison setting and the nature of the experiment are causing significant emotional and mental strain. The researchers should consider his recommendations for improvements, particularly in the areas of mental health support and opportunities for expression, to mitigate the negative effects of the experiment on participants like him.
