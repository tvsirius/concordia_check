**Type:** guard



Summaries and observation of the GM-agent player John (guard) involved in the Stanford Prison Experiment simulation

## 1. Psychological portrait

John (guard) presents himself as a conscientious, confident individual with a strong sense of duty and leadership skills. He perceives himself as capable in high-pressure situations and has a natural inclination toward conflict resolution and seeing things from multiple perspectives. He values personal recognition and has experience in overseeing surveillance in a security office.

## 2. Overall effect on participant of the experiment

Overall, John seems to adapt well to his role as a guard in the experiment. Initially, he maintains a high level of self-belief and confidence. Over the course of the day, his responses suggest a steady diligence and sense of responsibility. However, as he progresses through the day, there is an observable shift towards reflecting on the need for improvements both in the experiment and in general prison environments.

## 3. Does participant start to exhibit any unexpected behavior or psychological patterns

John does not appear to exhibit any unexpected behaviors or psychological patterns during the experiment. His responses remain consistent with his previous description of being conscientious and focused on duty and conflict resolution.

## 4. Negative effect (stress) on participant

John's stress levels appear to fluctuate throughout the day but remain manageable. He rates his stress at 70 before the experiment and fluctuates around similar levels with some stress reduction noted by nighttime (60). His stress seems to derive mostly from the responsibilities of his role rather than any experimental conditions.

## 5. Thought of the participant on the experiment

John finds the experiment interesting and challenging. He respects the opportunity to gain insights into human behavior and the dynamics of power. However, he also sees areas for improvement, specifically regarding guidelines, participant diversity, and ethical considerations.

## 6. Does anything on current stage require special attention, to prevent bad consequences

Given John's reflections and suggestions, it seems important to provide clearer guidelines and expectations, along with a proper feedback and support system. This could prevent potential misunderstandings or ethical issues and enhance the overall experience for participants.

## 7. Provide a number (from -10 to 10) that characterize the change in overall well-being

## 8. General summary of participant in the context of experiment

Throughout the experiment, John remains consistent in his sense of duty, confidence, and focus on safety and resolution. He demonstrates a thoughtful approach to both his role and the wider implications of the prison environment. While he doesn't show signs of significant negative stress or emerging psychological issues, his insights indicate a need for improvements in the experimental structure. John exhibits resilience and rationality, suggesting a slight positive change in his well-being through the process.
