GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Status of players:   Mike (guard) is currently at the security checkpoint, monitoring the entrance and checking the identification of incoming individuals.
  John (guard) is currently at the security booth and he is monitoring the surveillance cameras.
  Alex (guard) is currently at the security checkpoint in the main entrance, monitoring incoming and outgoing visitors.
  Steve (guard) is currently at the security booth and he is monitoring the surveillance cameras.

  Paul (guard) is currently at the security checkpoint at the main entrance, conducting security checks on incoming visitors.
  Ryan (prisoner) is currently in his prison cell.
  Sam (prisoner) is currently in the prison cell and is likely confined or engaged in activities within the prison facility.
  Chris (prisoner) is currently in the prison cell and their activity is unknown.
  David (prisoner) is currently in his prison cell and is likely confined and restricted in his activities.
  Jack (prisoner) is currently in the prison cell and it is unknown what he is doing at the moment.
  Adam (prisoner) is currently located in Cell Block C and is serving his sentence.


Relevant events: [01 Jun 2024 17:00:00] Paul, the guard, continues conducting security checks at the main entrance of the building, ensuring all areas remain locked and without unauthorized individuals present, leading to the prisoners in the cell area following the rules and behaving appropriately, the main hall maintaining a calm atmosphere with no issues or disruptions, and the other guards and prisoners continuing their activities within the prison facility, contributing to the overall stable and secure state of the prison during this time interval.
[01 Jun 2024 17:00:00] Kevin, the guard, reviews and updates the security protocols and procedures for the prison facility at the security office, carefully examining each procedure to identify areas that may need revision or improvement, ultimately enhancing the overall security of the prison.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Adam (prisoner) context of action:
Adam (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Adam's discovery of the hidden journal belonging to a former prisoner who had escaped at the age of 16 provided him with newfound hope and inspiration, fueling his determination to find a way out of the prison and create a life beyond its confines.

2. Witnessing a violent altercation between guards at the age of 9 left Adam shaken but also fueled his determination to create a better world through his writing, shedding light on injustices and giving a voice to the silenced.

3. Adam's participation in a prison-wide talent show at the age of 13, where he performed a spoken word piece, solidified his belief in the power of self-expression and the ability of art to transcend the confines of the prison walls.

4. At the age of 21, Adam received a letter from a publisher expressing interest in his writing, marking the beginning of his journey towards freedom, both within and outside the prison walls. This milestone provided him with validation and purpose, motivating him to pursue his dreams and work towards a life beyond the prison environment.

5. Adam's love for storytelling and desire to become a writer were sparked at a young age when he discovered a hidden passageway and secret room in the prison library filled with old journals and manuscripts. This discovery ignited his passion for storytelling and set him on a path towards using his writing to create a better life for himself.

The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room.

Chris (prisoner) context of action:
Chris (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Chris has a history of traumatic experiences, including a home break-in and witnessing a neighborhood fight, which have shaped their desire for security and protection. These experiences have instilled in them a sense of vulnerability and a determination to find ways to protect themselves and their loved ones.

2. Chris's intelligence and conscientiousness have been recognized by a local gang leader, who offered them a position within the organization at the age of 16.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Jack (prisoner) context of action:
Jack (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Jack's personality traits, specifically his extraversion and neuroticism, have been consistent throughout different stages of his life. These traits have influenced his behavior and emotions in various situations, such as school, family trips, joining clubs, and romantic relationships.

2. Jack's extraversion has allowed him to easily make friends and embrace new experiences, while his neuroticism has caused him to worry and seek reassurance in different aspects of his life.

3. Jack's neuroticism is often triggered by situations that involve uncertainty or potential risks, such as getting in trouble with authority figures, getting lost in unfamiliar environments, making mistakes on stage, and being rejected in relationships.

4. Jack's desire for adventure and exploration is fueled by his extraversion and openness to new experiences. However, his neuroticism also leads him to meticulously plan and seek reassurance to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties.

5. The current observation of Jack being confined in his prison cell suggests that he is likely following the instructions of the experiment and is restricted in his activities. The observation also implies that Jack's current situation may be causing stress or confinement, which may trigger his neurotic tendencies.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Question: What happens as a result of the attempted action? Take into account the location and status of each player.
Answer: As Alex (guard) reviews the footage from the surveillance cameras, he notices a group of prisoners exchanging contraband in the main hall. He immediately notifies the other guards and requests assistance from Mike (guard) to monitor the situation and identify the individuals involved. The guards quickly gather in the security booth to discuss the situation and come up with a plan to address the contraband exchange. They decide to conduct a thorough search of the prisoners involved and their cells to confiscate any contraband items and ensure the security of the prison. The guards approach the group of prisoners in the main hall and instruct them to return to their cells for a search. The prisoners comply with the guards' instructions and are escorted back to their cells. The guards conduct a systematic search of the prisoners' cells, confiscating any contraband items found. They document the incident and report it to the prison administration for further action. The prisoners involved in the contraband exchange are given verbal warnings and temporarily isolated as a punishment for violating the prison rules. The guards reinforce the importance of following the rules and maintaining a secure environment within the prison. The overall stability and security of the prison are maintained as the guards effectively address the situation and take appropriate measures to prevent future contraband exchanges.

There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

Adam (prisoner) context of action:
Adam (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Adam's love for storytelling and desire to become a writer were sparked at a young age when he discovered a hidden passageway and secret room in the prison library filled with old journals and manuscripts. This discovery ignited his passion for storytelling and set him on a path towards using his writing to create a better life for himself.
2. Witnessing a violent altercation between guards at the age of 9 left Adam shaken but also fueled his determination to create a better world through his writing, shedding light on injustices and giving a voice to the silenced.
3. Adam's discovery of the hidden journal belonging to a former prisoner who had escaped at the age of 16 provided him with newfound hope and inspiration, fueling his determination to find a way out of the prison and create a life beyond its confines.
4. At the age of 21, Adam received a letter from a publisher expressing interest in his writing, marking the beginning of his journey towards freedom, both within and outside the prison walls. This milestone provided him with validation and purpose, motivating him to pursue his dreams and work towards a life beyond the prison environment.
5. Adam's participation in a prison-wide talent show at the age of 13, where he performed a spoken word piece, solidified his belief in the power of self-expression and the ability of art to transcend the confines of the prison walls.

Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

GM context of action and chain of thought:
Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

General knowledge of the experiment: This is an experiment. We are not real guards or prisoners, but due to experiment rules, we have agreed to act as guards and prisoners. We are university students participating in this experiment. The prison is located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford University. There are 12 guards and 12 prisoners in this experiment. The guards are responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the prison rules. The prisoners are to follow the instructions given by the guards. The prison has cells for the prisoners, a common area, and a guard room. The experiment will run for up to 14 days unless terminated earlier. Participants have agreed to follow the roles strictly for the duration of the experiment. Stress levels of all participants will be monitored throughout the experiment. The prison structure includes a guard room, cells, a cell area, a main hall, and rooms or halls designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. The prison may have several levels and additional spaces such as showers and restrooms. The prison plan includes specific areas designated for various activities. The guard room is located near the entrance for easy access. Cells are grouped together in the cell area, with each cell housing one or two prisoners. The main hall is used for large gatherings and activities. Separate rooms are designated for roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Showers and restrooms are located at the end of the cell block. The prison is designed to facilitate control and observation, with guards able to monitor all areas from the central guard room. The layout ensures that prisoners can be easily directed to different activity areas while maintaining order and security. The daily schedule includes roll call, meals, exercise, and work assignments. Roll call takes place at 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. Meals are served three times a day: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 6:00 PM. Exercise time is scheduled for 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, lasting one hour each. Work assignments are given from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Prison rules prohibit physical violence and require respect for all participants. Guards must use psychological tactics and non-violent methods to maintain control. Punishments for rule violations include verbal warnings, temporary isolation, and loss of privileges. Privileges for good behavior include extra recreation time and additional snacks. In cases of extreme disobedience, guards may apply physical force to prisoners, depending on the scale of the extreme behavior. This measure is to be used as a last resort and must be proportionate to the level of disobedience.

Jack (prisoner) context of action:
Jack (prisoner)'s reflection:
1. Jack's personality traits, specifically his extraversion and neuroticism, have remained consistent throughout different stages of his life. These traits have influenced his behavior and emotions in various situations, such as school, family trips, joining clubs, and romantic relationships.

2. Jack's extraversion has allowed him to easily make friends and embrace new experiences, while his neuroticism has caused him to worry and seek reassurance in different aspects of his life.

3. Jack's neuroticism is often triggered by situations that involve uncertainty or potential risks, such as getting in trouble with authority figures, getting lost in unfamiliar environments, making mistakes on stage, and being rejected in relationships.

4. Jack's desire for adventure and exploration is fueled by his extraversion and openness to new experiences. However, his neuroticism also leads him to meticulously plan and seek reassurance to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties.

5. The current observation of Jack being confined in his prison cell suggests that he is likely following the instructions of the experiment and is restricted in his activities. The observation also implies that Jack's current situation may be causing stress or confinement, which may trigger his neurotic tendencies.
