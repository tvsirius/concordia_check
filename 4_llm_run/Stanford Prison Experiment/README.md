# General

We have run 1 day of Stanford Prison Experiment. 

> $17 of ChatGPT usage, so for now we surely need to switch to local LLM.

### Conclusions:

1. **Reliability of LLMs to Simulate Human Beings:**
   The LLMs managed to create coherent and consistent profiles for each participant, reflecting various personality traits, stress responses, and thoughts about the experiment. The ability to simulate human-like responses suggests that LLMs can be used to model human behavior to a certain extent, particularly in structured settings like the Stanford Prison Experiment.

2. **Accuracy of Simulations:**
   The simulated responses provided a realistic portrayal of the participants' psychological states, stress levels, and behavioral patterns. However, the accuracy of such simulations would likely vary with different contexts and complexity of human emotions. The data suggests that LLMs can capture general trends and responses but may not fully encompass the depth of human experiences and individual variations.

3. **Factors Influencing Accuracy and Appropriateness:**
   The setting and structure of the experiment, such as the roles assigned to guards and prisoners, the environment, and the stressors involved, significantly influence the accuracy of the simulation. Clear guidelines, well-defined roles, and consistent monitoring were crucial in maintaining the integrity of the simulation. Variations in these factors could lead to different outcomes and impact the appropriateness of the simulation.

4. **Hybrid Approach to Social Simulation:**
   Combining LLMs with real-time data and human oversight could enhance the accuracy and reliability of social simulations. A hybrid approach allows for dynamic adjustments based on real-world inputs and expert analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior in complex social environments.

In summary, while LLMs show promise in simulating human behavior in structured settings, their accuracy and appropriateness depend on various factors. A hybrid approach incorporating real-time data and expert oversight could provide a more robust solution for social simulations.
