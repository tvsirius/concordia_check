# Concordia_Check

Welcome to **Concordia_Check** Data Science project. This is a capstone project for the ELO part of the [MIT Emerging Talent 2023](https://emergingtalent.mit.edu/) Program

## Project description

*Can we really rely on LLMs (via Concordia) to simulate human beings?*

This project is based on [Concordia](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia) - a library for using LLMs to facilitate constructing and working with Generative Agent-Based Models (GABM), which can apply common sense to situations, act “reasonably,” recall common semantic knowledge, and communicate both within the simulation and to researchers viewing it from the outside.

Concordia allows the construction of language-mediated simulations of physically or digitally grounded environments and was designed to support a wide array of applications in scientific research and for evaluating the performance of real digital services by simulating users and/or generating synthetic data. This library may offer additional insights for using it not only for social simulations. We can imagine possible intersections with scenic art, psychology, science fiction, and many more. But first, the more important question comes to mind.

Concordia's general approach is to model living beings using LLMs and simulate virtual space inhabited by these "LLM-powered beings". One of the main proposed applications is social modeling, simulation, and predicting behavioral patterns of populations.

Let's find out if we can really rely on LLMs to simulate humans. How accurate could the results of such simulations be?

It should be possible to find some real social simulations conducted on populations of medium size. We will look for simulations of this kind that can be transformed into the Concordia virtual settings. And we will run this simulation in Concordia. Check if we need any fine-tuning. See what we get and compare it to the known results of the simulation we choose.

And I believe this is the way we will find answers to our question.


## Repository structure and navigation

The repository is organized in folders that corresponds to milestones. 
This project have started 2024 March. All documents are live documents now. 


## Milestones:

1. [**Problem Identification**](1_problem_identification) - Clarifying project idea, description, research questions, goals, constraints.
2. [**Concordia Demo Scene**](2_concordia_demo_scene) - Getting used to Concordia, running a small demo simulation.
3. [**Data Collection**](3_data_collection) - Selection of real social simulations.
4. **Local LLM, Simulation run** - Comprehending Concordia on a large scale. Local LLM usage. Starting our first run and optimizing approach to simulations.
5. **Data Analysis** - Scripting simulations into Concordia, running, adjusting and fine-tuning settings.
6. **Comparison and Analysis** - Comparing the outcomes with real data, analyzing findings.
7. **Communicating Results**


### [1 Problem Identification](1_problem_identification)

This milestone will have a clearly stated project idea, goals, constraints, research questions as deliverables.
[Read more...](1_problem_identification).

### [2 Concordia Demo Scene](2_concordia_demo_scene)

In this milestone we are exploring Concordia and running several demo simulations. [Read more...](2_concordia_demo_scene)

**Milestone 2 conclusions:**

- Local LLM deployment, like Llama 3. Need step, that will allow for experimentation of large scale. Comparison of simulation results with local vs OpenAI LLM could be considered. 
- This concept of **Chain Of Thought** should be well understood for further steps. 
- An experiment with 1-10 actors should be preferable options for the start.

### [3 Data Collection](3_data_collection)

In this milestone we will find several real life documented simulations, that could be scripted into Concordia settings. [Read more...](3_data_collection)

### 4 Local LLM, Simulation run

### 5 Data Analysis

### 6 Comparison and Analysis

### 7 Communicating Results
